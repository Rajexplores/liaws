Initially on a trial period for a limited amount of leads in March, I noticed a big difference from Franchise Opportunities Network leads vs the others I've tried. The following month, I received a lead on April 22nd. As of the 1st of June, that lead is now a new InstaPartner!!! It's very rewarding to see such a quick return on investment.

After only 10 days of advertising we received a lead on January 18th that ended up turning into our very first franchise!
                           From the very beginning Lee Payne and his team have been incredibly easy and knowledgeable to work with. Lee took time to explain to me how I should work each lead and what I should expect during the process. His advice and encouragement was instrumental in getting our first franchise established and turning manyof our other leads into stronger leads. 
                           I also want to mention how fair him and his team has been when we receive a bad lead.
                           I have been very pleased with the Franchise Opportunities Network so far and highly recommend them to anyone who owns a Franchise and is looking for a highly reputable lead company. "

My experience with the Franchise Opportunities Network has been extremely positive. I receive a reliable quantity of qualified inquiries every month and find that the leading indicators are very good with this group of sites. I have more interactions with FON candidates, receive more applications and schedule more discovery days. Most franchise professionals know that these are the indicators that lead to more franchise sales. My account representative, Lee Payne, is very responsive and active in assisting with decisions. I look forward to working with FON for years to come and having more success wih inquiries from FON portals."</p>

                        <p>"Dear Franchise Opportunities Network:&lt;br&gt;I want to share with you the addition of a great new Strategic Partner with The Employers Edge. Christina requested information about our business opportunity on 9/25/11. She wasn’t in a hurry to do anything as she had a contractual engagement for the next 2 years. As we talked, she fully realized that our opportunity was what she was looking for next. She attended a 3-day Fast Start training in early December and got so excited by what she heard and saw that she verbally committed to coming into the business. She had to make some arrangements to get out of her contract, but on 1/18/12, she became a Strategic Partner. So, in just under 4 months, and with some real obstacle t overcome, we helped her realize her dream of business ownership. As a side note, after less than a week in the business, she has already set appointments and has a proposal for training. Thanks for your part in making this happen!"</p>

Not only is their product superior, but their staff is always available to their clients with their years of expertise in lead generation, web copy and customer service in general.

It is crucial that every dollar spent go as far as possible in achieving a solid return on your investment. In a time where it seems as though a new internet portal pops up on a daily basis, Franchise Opportunities.com has been a constant part of our marketing plan. Since we started advertising with them in early 2007, they have been instrumental in helping Jan-Pro Franchising International in being named as the # 1 Fastest Growing Franchise in US for 2008 &amp; 2009 by Entrepreneur magazine. In addition to producing quality leads, their customer service and sales support is secod to none. The leads we receive from Franchise Opportunities.com are always qualified and interested, and we feel confident that we are calling on a serious prospect when we receive their leads. I would fully recommend and endorse anyone that is considering the addition of a lead portal for their franchise development needs."</p>

                        <p>"We chose to start marketing our business opportunity through
                           FranchiseOpportunites.com in March of 2013. We just barely reached our one-
                           year anniversary. I am so happy to report that we sold 8 units in our first twelve 
                           months as a direct result from the leads they have provided us. The quality of the 
                           entrepreneurs they have brought to us has been phenomenal. Needless to say, I 
                           would highly recommend their service!"
